# P2P Video Chat Web App with Posture Detection
This is a peer-to-peer video chat web application that comes with posture detection functionality. It is built using React.js for the front end, Tailwind CSS for styling, and WebRTC for real-time communication between peers.

The app allows users to initiate video calls with others, with the added feature of posture detection using machine learning algorithms. This feature helps users maintain a good posture during video calls, which can prevent neck and back pain caused by poor posture.

The application has a user-friendly interface that displays a video feed of the current call participant, with posture feedback overlaid on top. The app also includes features such as chat messaging, screen sharing, and muting.
